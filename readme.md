In Week 5: Functions - Array Manipulation and Scope you will begin by using built-in functions to manipulate arrays and strings. 
You will then use template literals and fat arrows, introduced in ES6, to code more efficiently. Finally, you will 
import Boston salary data in a 
JSON format and manipulate it to find key metrics in the Walk Boston Exercise.
